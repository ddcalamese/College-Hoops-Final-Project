Research Question:
In comparing two of the major conferences for college sports, is there any correlation to be found between the advanced Win Shares statistics (as found on basketball-reference.com) and team success (i.e. conference win percentage)?

Answer: Somewhat....especially when it relates to the SUM of overall team Win Shares. In terms of individual win shares, the connection isn't quite as significant, but (mainly in the SEC) there exists a slight connection.
